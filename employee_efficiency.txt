SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION (SRS)

Project Title: Government Employee Efficiency Tracker with Aadhaar-Based
OTP Verified Public Feedback System (Simulation Model)

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose This document specifies the complete software requirements
for the Government Employee Efficiency Tracker system. The system is
designed to monitor employee performance, manage task assignments, and
collect verified public feedback through a simulated Aadhaar-based OTP
authentication mechanism.

1.2 Scope The system provides: - Employee and department management -
Task assignment and deadline tracking - Efficiency score calculation -
Simulated Aadhaar validation (12-digit format check) - OTP generation
and verification - Verified citizen feedback submission - Duplicate
feedback prevention - Department-wise performance reporting

1.3 Intended Audience This document is intended for: - Developers -
Project supervisors - Evaluators - Academic reviewers

1.4 Definitions OTP – One Time Password Efficiency Score – Performance
metric calculated for employees Citizen Registry – Simulated Aadhaar
database Admin – System controller Department Head – Supervisory
authority

2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION

2.1 Product Perspective The system is a standalone C++ console-based
application developed using: - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) -
Standard Template Library (STL) - File Handling or MySQL for persistent
storage

2.2 Product Functions - Add and manage employees - Assign and track
tasks - Detect task delays - Register citizens (simulated Aadhaar
registry) - Generate and validate OTP - Allow verified feedback
submission - Calculate efficiency scores - Generate analytical reports

2.3 User Classes Admin – Full system access Department Head – Task
assignment and monitoring Employee – View assigned tasks Citizen –
Submit verified feedback

2.4 Operating Environment - Windows or Linux OS - C++ Compiler (GCC /
MinGW / Visual Studio) - Optional MySQL Server

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Three-Tier Architecture:

1.  Presentation Layer – Console-based UI
2.  Application Logic Layer – Business logic & validation
3.  Data Storage Layer – File system or MySQL database

Core Modules: - Employee Management Module - Task Management Module -
Citizen Registry Module - OTP Manager Module - Feedback Management
Module - Performance Analytics Module

4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Employee Management: FR1: Add employee records FR2: Assign tasks with
deadlines FR3: Track task completion FR4: Detect delayed tasks

Aadhaar Simulation: FR5: Validate 12-digit Aadhaar format FR6: Hash
Aadhaar ID before storage FR7: Fetch citizen data after OTP verification

OTP Verification: FR8: Generate 6-digit random OTP FR9: OTP expiry after
2–5 minutes FR10: Maximum 3 OTP attempts

Feedback System: FR11: Only verified citizens can submit feedback FR12:
One feedback per citizen per task FR13: Rating scale 1–5 FR14: Feedback
cannot be modified after submission FR15: Efficiency score updates
automatically

Reporting: FR16: Generate employee efficiency report FR17:
Department-wise ranking FR18: Monthly performance summary

5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Security: - Aadhaar ID hashing - OTP expiry and attempt limitation -
Role-based authentication - Audit logs

Performance: - Handle minimum 1000 records - Efficient data retrieval

Reliability: - Persistent data storage - Input validation and error
handling

Usability: - Menu-driven interface - Clear error messages

6. ALGORITHMS

OTP Generation Algorithm: 1. Generate random 6-digit number 2. Store OTP
with timestamp 3. Allow maximum 3 attempts 4. Validate expiry before
verification

Efficiency Calculation: completion_rate = completed_tasks / total_tasks
average_rating = total_rating / total_feedback

efficiency_score = (completion_rate * 50) + (average_rating * 30) +
(on_time_percentage * 20) - delay_penalty

7. DATABASE DESIGN

Employees Table: - employee_id (Primary Key) - name - department -
efficiency_score

Tasks Table: - task_id (Primary Key) - employee_id (Foreign Key) -
deadline - completion_date - status

Citizens Table: - hashed_aadhaar (Primary Key) - name - address - mobile

Feedback Table: - feedback_id (Primary Key) - employee_id (Foreign
Key) - citizen_hash (Foreign Key) - rating - comment

8. SYSTEM FLOW

Admin Flow: Login -> Add Employee -> Assign Task -> View Reports

Citizen Feedback Flow: Enter Aadhaar -> Validate -> Generate OTP ->
Verify OTP -> Fetch Data -> Submit Feedback -> Update Efficiency

9. TESTING STRATEGY

Unit Testing: - Test employee addition - Test OTP generation - Test
feedback submission

Integration Testing: - Test OTP + feedback flow - Test efficiency update

System Testing: - Full workflow validation

Security Testing: - OTP expiry validation - Duplicate feedback
prevention

10. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

-   GUI implementation using Qt
-   Web-based deployment
-   Real SMS API integration
-   Sentiment analysis
-   Data visualization dashboard
-   Cloud hosting support

CONCLUSION

The Government Employee Efficiency Tracker with Aadhaar-Based OTP
Simulation ensures transparency, accountability, and verified public
participation. The system integrates OOP concepts, data structures,
security mechanisms, and analytical evaluation to provide a robust
academic project solution.
